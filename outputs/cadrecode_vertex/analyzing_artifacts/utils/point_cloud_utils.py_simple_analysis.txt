# Logic Analysis: utils/point_cloud_utils.py

## Overview
This module provides essential point cloud processing utilities that serve as foundational components for CAD-Recode. It implements core operations mentioned throughout the paper including furthest point sampling (Section 4.2), Gaussian noise augmentation (Section 4.3), and coordinate normalization (Appendix B). These utilities are shared across multiple components including the point cloud projector, dataset loader, and evaluation pipeline.

## Core Functions Analysis

### 1. furthest_point_sampling(point_cloud, num_points)
**Purpose**: Downsample input point clouds to exactly `num_points` using furthest point sampling algorithm as specified in Section 4.2.

**Logic Flow**:
- Input: point_cloud tensor of shape (N, 3), target num_points (default 256 from config)
- Initialize with random first point
- Iteratively select points that are furthest from already selected points
- Compute distances using Euclidean distance in 3D space
- Return tensor of shape (num_points, 3)

**Key Considerations**:
- Handle edge case where input has fewer points than requested
- Ensure deterministic behavior for reproducibility when seed is set
- Optimize for GPU computation when input is on CUDA device
- Support both torch tensors and numpy arrays as input

### 2. add_gaussian_noise(point_cloud, noise_std=0.01, probability=0.5)
**Purpose**: Apply data augmentation through Gaussian noise as described in Section 4.3 training strategy.

**Logic Flow**:
- Input: point_cloud tensor, noise_std (0.01 from config), probability (0.5 from config)
- Generate random decision based on probability
- If noise should be applied, sample from N(0, noise_stdÂ²) for each coordinate
- Add noise to original coordinates: new_coords = original_coords + noise
- Return augmented point cloud maintaining original shape

**Key Considerations**:
- Preserve original point cloud when probability check fails
- Ensure noise is sampled independently for each point and coordinate
- Maintain device consistency (CPU/CUDA)
- Handle batch processing for training efficiency

### 3. normalize_point_cloud(point_cloud, method="unit_box")
**Purpose**: Normalize point clouds to fit within unit bounding box as specified in Appendix B dataset generation.

**Logic Flow**:
- Input: point_cloud tensor, normalization method
- For "unit_box" method:
  - Compute bounding box: min_coords, max_coords across all dimensions
  - Calculate center: (min_coords + max_coords) / 2
  - Calculate scale: max(max_coords - min_coords)
  - Apply transformation: (coords - center) / scale
- Return normalized point cloud centered at origin with max extent = 1

**Key Considerations**:
- Handle degenerate cases (all points identical, single coordinate span)
- Preserve relative spatial relationships
- Support different normalization strategies for future extensibility
- Return transformation parameters for potential inverse operations

### 4. mesh_to_point_cloud(mesh, num_points=8192)
**Purpose**: Convert CAD meshes to point clouds for evaluation metrics computation.

**Logic Flow**:
- Input: mesh object (from CAD code execution), target number of points
- Use uniform sampling on mesh surface
- Ensure exactly num_points are generated
- Return point cloud tensor of shape (num_points, 3)

**Key Considerations**:
- Handle different mesh formats (trimesh, open3d mesh)
- Ensure uniform distribution across surface area
- Support both evaluation (8192 points) and training sampling

### 5. validate_point_cloud(point_cloud)
**Purpose**: Validate point cloud format and properties for robust processing.

**Logic Flow**:
- Check tensor/array format and shape (N, 3)
- Verify no NaN or infinite values
- Ensure reasonable coordinate ranges
- Return validation status and error messages

**Key Considerations**:
- Provide informative error messages for debugging
- Handle both torch tensors and numpy arrays
- Check for empty point clouds

### 6. batch_process_point_clouds(point_clouds, processing_fn, **kwargs)
**Purpose**: Efficiently process batches of point clouds for training/evaluation.

**Logic Flow**:
- Input: list/batch of point clouds, processing function, function arguments
- Apply processing function to each point cloud in batch
- Handle memory management for large batches
- Return processed batch maintaining order

**Key Considerations**:
- Support GPU batch processing
- Handle variable-size point clouds in batch
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
