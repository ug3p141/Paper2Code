# Logic Analysis: training/trainer.py

## Overview
The `training/trainer.py` module implements the core training loop for CAD-Recode, following the end-to-end training strategy described in Section 4.3 of the paper. This module orchestrates the training of both the point cloud projector (trained from scratch) and the pre-trained LLM (fine-tuned) using Negative Log-Likelihood loss on procedurally generated CAD code sequences.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Training Strategy Implementation
- **End-to-End Training**: Train point cloud projector from scratch while fine-tuning the pre-trained Qwen2-1.5B LLM
- **Loss Function**: Implement Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss for next-token prediction on CAD code sequences
- **Sequence Handling**: Manage special tokens (`<s>` start, `<e>` end) to demarcate sequence boundaries
- **Input Processing**: Handle concatenated point cloud query tokens and code tokens as input to LLM

### 2. Optimizer and Scheduler Configuration
- **AdamW Optimizer**: Learning rate 0.0002, weight decay 0.01, other parameters at HuggingFace defaults
- **Cosine Learning Rate Scheduler**: Implement cosine annealing schedule with 1k warmup steps
- **Training Duration**: 100k iterations total with proper warmup handling
- **Gradient Management**: Handle gradient accumulation if needed for effective batch size

### 3. Training Loop Architecture
- **Epoch-based Training**: Implement train_epoch() method for single epoch processing
- **Validation Integration**: Regular validation during training with validate() method
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor training metrics, loss curves, and validation performance
- **Checkpointing**: Save model state, optimizer state, and training progress at regular intervals

## Detailed Logic Analysis

### Class Structure: Trainer

#### Initialization (`__init__`)
**Purpose**: Set up all training components and validate configuration
**Logic Flow**:
1. Store model reference (CADRecodeModel instance)
2. Store data loaders (train_loader, val_loader)
3. Extract training configuration from config.yaml:
   - learning_rate: 0.0002
   - weight_decay: 0.01
   - num_iterations: 100000
   - warmup_steps: 1000
   - batch_size: 18
4. Initialize AdamW optimizer with model parameters
5. Initialize cosine learning rate scheduler with warmup
6. Set up logging (wandb integration)
7. Initialize training state tracking (current iteration, best validation loss)
8. Set device (CUDA) and mixed precision settings

**Key Considerations**:
- Separate parameter groups for point cloud projector (from scratch) vs LLM (fine-tuning)
- Proper scheduler initialization with total training steps
- Wandb configuration for experiment tracking

#### Training Epoch (`train_epoch`)
**Purpose**: Execute one complete training epoch
**Logic Flow**:
1. Set model to training mode
2. Initialize epoch metrics (total_loss, num_batches)
3. For each batch in train_loader:
   a. Move data to device (point_clouds, input_ids, attention_mask, labels)
   b. Zero gradients
   c. Forward pass through CADRecodeModel:
      - Point cloud → query tokens via projector
      - Concatenate query tokens with code tokens
      - LLM forward pass for next-token prediction
   d. Compute NLL loss on predicted vs target tokens
   e. Backward pass and optimizer step
   f. Update learning rate scheduler
   g. Log metrics (loss, learning rate, iteration)
4. Return average epoch loss

**Key Considerations**:
- Proper handling of sequence padding and attention masks
- Token shifting for next-token prediction (input vs target sequences)
- Gradient clipping if needed for stability
- Memory management for large point clouds and LLM

#### Validation (`validate`)
**Purpose**: Evaluate model performance on validation set
**Logic Flow**:
1. Set model to evaluation mode
2. Disable gradient computation
3. Initialize validation metrics
4. For each validation batch:
   a. Forward pass (same as training but no gradients)
   b. Compute validation loss
   c. Optional: Generate sample CAD codes for qualitative assessment
   d. Validate generated codes using CADValidator
5. Compute average validation loss and metrics
6. Log validation results
7. Return validation metrics

**Key Considerations**:
- No gradient updates during validation
- Sample generation for monitoring code quality
- Early stopping criteria based on validation loss
- Memory efficiency during evaluation

#### Main Training Loop (`train`)
**Purpose**: Orchestrate complete training process
**Logic Flow**:
1. Initialize training state and best model tracking
2. For each epoch up to num_iterations:
   a. Call train_epoch() and get training loss
   b. Call validate() and get validation metrics
   c. Check for improvement and save best model
   d. Save regular checkpoints based on save_interval
   e. Log epoch summary to wandb
   f. Check early stopping conditions
3. Save final model and training summary
4. Return training history

**Key Considerations**:
- Conversion between iterations and epochs based on dataset size
- Best model selection criteria (validation loss)
- Proper checkpoint saving with all necessary state
- Training termination conditions

#### Checkpoint Management (`save_checkpoint`, `load_checkpoint`)
**Purpose**: Handle model state persistence and recovery

**save_checkpoint Logic**:
1. Create checkpoint dictionary containing:
   - Model state dict (both projector and LLM)
   - Optimizer state dict
   - Scheduler state dict
   - Current iteration/epoch
   - Best validation loss
   - Training configuration
   - Random seeds for reproducibility
2. Save to specified path with proper naming convention
3. Maintain multiple checkpoint versions if needed

**load_checkpoint Logic**:
1. Load checkpoint dictionary from path
2. Restore model state (handle device mapping)
3. Restore optimizer and scheduler states
4. Restore training progress counters
5. Restore random states for reproducibility
6. Validate checkpoint compatibility with current configuration

## Data Flow and Loss Computation

### Input Processing
1. **Point Cloud**: Shape (batch_size, num_points, 3) → Projector → Query tokens (batch_size, num_points, embedding_dim)
2. **Code Tokens**: Tokenized CAD code sequences with special tokens
3. **Concatenation**: [Query tokens; Code tokens] → LLM input
4. **Attention Masks**: Proper masking for variable-length sequences

### Loss Computation
1. **Target Preparation**: Shift input tokens by one position for next-token prediction
2. **Logits**: LLM output logits for vocabulary prediction
3. **NLL Loss**: Cross-entropy loss between predicted and target tokens
4. **Masking**: Ignore loss on padding tokens and special tokens where appropriate
